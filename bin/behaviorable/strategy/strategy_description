Strategy Design Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.	
Strategy lets the algoithms vary independently from clients that use it.

Design Principles:
1. Encapsulate what varies
2. Program to interfaces, not to implementations
3. Favor composition over inheritance

In short, it is a good idea to isolate the algorithms in separate classes in order to have the ability to select different
 algorithms at runtime.
