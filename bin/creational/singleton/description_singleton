Singleton Pattern restricts the instantiation of a class and ensures that only one instance of the class exists in java virtual 
machine. 
The singleton class must provide a global access point to get the instance of the class.
Singleton pattern is used for logging, driver objects , caching, and thread pool.
Singleton Design pattern is also used in other design patterns - Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype, Facade, etc.
