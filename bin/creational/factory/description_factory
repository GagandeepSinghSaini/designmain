The Abstract Factory method provides an interface for creating families of related and dependent objects 
without specifying their concrete classes.
Example: 

The Factory design pattern is used when we have asuper class with multiple sub-classes and based on input, we return object of one of the subclass.
Example of Factory Method: Game, in which we have different levels. So, we keep different factories for different levels, 
to create level instances.

Design Principle:
1. Dependency Inversion Principle (depend upon abstraction, do not depend upon concrete classes).
