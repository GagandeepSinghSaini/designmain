Facade pattern hides the complexities of the system and provides an interface to the client using which the client 
can access the system. This pattern involves a single class which provides simplified methods required by 
client and delegates calls to methods of existing system classes.

Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Façade defines a higher-level interface that makes 
the subsystem easier to use.

Facades are all around us in the real world.  Operating systems are one such example - 
you don't see all the inner workings of your computer, but the OS provides a simplified interface to use the machine. 

When to Use Facade Design Pattern:
As the concept behind facade is to simplify an interface, service oriented architectures make use of the facade pattern. 
For example, in web services, one web service might provide access to a number of smaller services that have been hidden 
from the caller by the facade.
