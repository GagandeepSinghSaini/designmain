Composite design pattern allows you to have a tree structure and ask each node in the tree structure to perform a task.
Example: organization
It have general managers and under general managers, there can be managers and  under managers there can be developers.

"Compose objects into tree structure to represent part-whole hierarchies.Composite lets client treat individual objects 
and compositions of objects uniformly".

Composite design pattern treats each node in two ways-Composite or leaf.Composite means it can have other objects below it.
leaf means it has no objects below it.

When to use:
--> you want to represent part-whole hierachies of objects.
--> you want client to be able to ignore difference between compositions of objects and individual objects.Clients will treat all 
objects in the composite structure uniformly.
