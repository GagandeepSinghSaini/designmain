DAO stands for Data Access Object. DAO Design Pattern is used to separate the data persistence 
logic in a separate layer. This way, the service remains completely in dark about how the 
low-level operations to access the database is done. 
Also, known as Separation of logic.	

We make a layer in between the interaction between the DB and the application.
